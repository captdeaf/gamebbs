Take my love.~~~~~ Take my land.
Take me where I cannot stand.
I don't care.~~~~~ I'm still free.~~~~
You can't take the sky from me.
~~~~~~~~
Take me out to the black.
Tell them I ain't comin' back.
Burn the lands and boil the sea.~~~~
You can't take the sky from me.
~~~~~~~~~~~
Have no place I can be.
Since I found Serenity.~~~~
But you c~a~n~'~t ~t~a~k~e~
The sky from me.
